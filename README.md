Scatterbrain is designed to help you break down complex problems into manageable, hierarchical tasks. Its primary strength lies in its **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server**, which seamlessly integrates with AI assistants like Claude and Cursor, enabling intelligent task management and planning workflows.

## üöÄ Quick Start (MCP Server)

### Installation

#### Pre-built Binaries (Recommended)

**Shell Script (macOS/Linux):**
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/owen-d/scatterbrain/releases/latest/download/scatterbrain-installer.sh | sh
```

**PowerShell (Windows):**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://github.com/owen-d/scatterbrain/releases/latest/download/scatterbrain-installer.ps1 | iex"
```

**Direct Download:**
Download pre-built binaries for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/owen-d/scatterbrain/releases/latest):
- **macOS**: `scatterbrain-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.xz` (Apple Silicon) or `scatterbrain-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.xz` (Intel)
- **Linux**: `scatterbrain-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.xz` (x64) or `scatterbrain-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.xz` (ARM64)
- **Windows**: `scatterbrain-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip`

#### Build from Source

```bash
# Install Rust if you haven't already
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Clone and build scatterbrain
git clone https://github.com/owen-d/scatterbrain.git
cd scatterbrain
cargo build --release

# Install globally (optional)
cargo install --path .
```

### MCP Server Setup

#### For Cursor

Once installed, all you need to do is add the following to your Cursor MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "scatterbrain": {
      "command": "scatterbrain",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```


#### Start MCP Server

```bash
# Basic MCP server
scatterbrain mcp

# With example data for testing
scatterbrain mcp --example

# With web UI exposed on port 8080
scatterbrain mcp --expose 8080
```

## üìö Documentation

- **[MCP Integration Guide](docs/MCP-GUIDE.md)** - Complete guide to using scatterbrain with AI assistants
- **[CLI Reference](docs/CLI-REFERENCE.md)** - Comprehensive command documentation
- **[Web UI Guide](docs/WEB-UI.md)** - Browser interface walkthrough
- **[Examples & Patterns](docs/EXAMPLES.md)** - Real-world usage scenarios

## üéØ Core Concepts

### Hierarchical Planning
Scatterbrain organizes work across four abstraction levels:

1. **Planning (Level 0)** - High-level goals and architecture
2. **Isolation (Level 1)** - Independent components and boundaries  
3. **Ordering (Level 2)** - Sequence and dependencies
4. **Implementation (Level 3)** - Concrete, actionable tasks

### MCP Tools
When running as an MCP server, scatterbrain provides these tools to AI assistants:

- `get_plan` - Retrieve plan details and structure
- `create_plan` - Create new plans from prompts
- `add_task` - Add tasks at appropriate abstraction levels
- `complete_task` - Mark tasks as completed with summaries
- `move_to` - Navigate between tasks
- `get_current` - Get current task context
- `get_distilled_context` - Get focused planning context
- And 10 more specialized tools for comprehensive task management

## üöÄ Release Process (Maintainers)

Scatterbrain uses automated releases powered by [cargo-dist](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/). To create a new release:

1. **Update version** in `Cargo.toml`
2. **Commit changes** and push to main branch
3. **Create and push a git tag**:
   ```bash
   git tag v0.2.0
   git push origin v0.2.0
   ```
4. **GitHub Actions automatically**:
   - Builds binaries for all supported platforms
   - Creates installers (shell script and PowerShell)
   - Generates checksums and release notes
   - Publishes GitHub release with all assets

**Supported Platforms:**
- macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel)
- Linux (x64 and ARM64)
