Scatterbrain keeps an AI Agent on task, so you don't have to. It does this by treating the AI to act as a planner and implementer, in alternating fashion. This helps the AI break down complex problems into manageable, hierarchical tasks and more importantly, keeps it on track. Its primary strength lies in its **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server**, which seamlessly integrates with AI assistants like Claude and Cursor, enabling intelligent task management and planning workflows.

### MCP Server Setup

#### For Cursor

Once installed, all you need to do is add the following to your Cursor MCP configuration (expose is optional, but allows you to follow progress via the web interface):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "scatterbrain": {
      "command": "scatterbrain",
      "args": [
        "mcp",
        "--expose",
        "3099"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

#### Planning Interface

Scatterbrain's hierarchical planning system helps you break down complex projects into manageable tasks across multiple abstraction levels:

As you work through your plan, the interface shows your progress and maintains context across all levels:

## üéØ Core Concepts

### Hierarchical Planning
Scatterbrain organizes work across four abstraction levels:

1. **Planning (Level 0)** - High-level goals and architecture
2. **Isolation (Level 1)** - Independent components and boundaries  
3. **Ordering (Level 2)** - Sequence and dependencies
4. **Implementation (Level 3)** - Concrete, actionable tasks

### MCP Tools
When running as an MCP server, scatterbrain provides these tools to AI assistants:

- `get_plan` - Retrieve plan details and structure
- `create_plan` - Create new plans from prompts
- `add_task` - Add tasks at appropriate abstraction levels
- `complete_task` - Mark tasks as completed with summaries
- `move_to` - Navigate between tasks
- `get_current` - Get current task context
- `get_distilled_context` - Get focused planning context
- And 10 more specialized tools for comprehensive task management
